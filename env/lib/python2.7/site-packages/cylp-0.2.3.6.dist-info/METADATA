License: Common Public License Version 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

    i) changes to the Program, and

    ii) additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

Description: Important Notice
        ==================
        To comply with PEP8 we decided to rename the package name from CyLP to cylp,
        which was long overdue.
        It affects the package name ONLY and a simple replace can make your program
        work with the new settings.
        Thank you for your understanding.
        
        
        What is CyLP?
        ==============
        CyLP is a Python interface to COIN-ORs Linear and mixed-integer program solvers
        (CLP, CBC, and CGL). CyLPs unique feature is that you can use it to alter the
        solution process of the solvers from within Python. For example, you may
        define cut generators, branch-and-bound strategies, and primal/dual Simplex
        pivot rules completely in Python.
        
        You may read your LP from an mps file or use the CyLPs easy modeling
        facility. Please find examples in the `documentation
        <http://mpy.github.io/cylpdoc/>`_.
        
        .. note::
        
           CyLP interfaces a limited number of functionalities of
           COIN-ORs solvers. If there is any particular
           class or method in CLP, CBC, and CGL that you would like to use in Python
           please don't hesitate to let us know; we will try to make the connections.
           Moreover, in the case that you find a bug or a mistake, we would appreciate
           it if you notify us. Contact us at mehdi [dot] towhidi [at] gerad [dot] ca.
        
        
        Who uses CyLP
        ==============
        CyLP is being used in a wide range of practical and research fields. Some of the users include:

        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install CyLP is by using the binaries. If that's not
        possible you may always compile it from source.
        
        Requirements
        --------------
        
        CyLP needs Numpy (www.numpy.org) and Scipy (www.scipy.org). If you wish to install CyLP from source, you will also need to compile Cbc. Details of this process is given below.
        
        Binary Installation
        ----------------------
        
        If you have setuptools installed you may run::
        
            $ easy_install cylp
        
        If a binary is available for your architecture it will be installed. Otherwise
        you will see an error telling you to specify where to find a Cbc installation.
        That's because easy_install is trying to compile the source. In this case
        you'll have to compile Cbc and set and environment variable to point to it
        before calling easy_install again. The details are given in the `Installing
        from source`_ section.
        
        
        
        Installing from source
        ========================
        
        STEP 1:
            Install CBC (http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cbc/).
            CyLP can be compiled against
            Cbc version 2.8.5. Please go to the installation directory and run::
        
                $ ./configure
                $ make
                $ make install
        
        STEP 2:
            Create an environment variable called COIN_INSTALL_DIR pointing to your
            installation of Coin. For example::
        
                $ export COIN_INSTALL_DIR=/Users/mehdi/Cbc-2.8.5
        
        You may also add this line to your ~/.bash_rc or ~/.profile to make
        it persistent.
        
        STEP 3:
            Install CyLP. Go to CyLP's root directory and run::
        
                $ python setup.py install
        
        STEP 4 (LINUX):
             In linux you might also need to add COIN's lib directory to
             LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows::
        
                $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/Cbc-2.8.5/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
        
        Optional step:
            If you want to run the doctests (i.e. ``make doctest`` in the ``doc`` directory)
            you should also define::
        
                $ export CYLP_SOURCE_DIR=/Path/to/cylp
        
        Now you can use CyLP in your python code. For example::
        
            >>> from cylp.cy import CyClpSimplex
            >>> s = CyClpSimplex()
            >>> s.readMps('../input/netlib/adlittle.mps')
            0
            >>> s.initialSolve()
            'optimal'
            >>> round(s.objectiveValue, 3)
            225494.963
        
        Or simply go to CyLP and run::
        
            $ python -m unittest discover
        
        to run all CyLP unit tests.
        
        
        
        Modeling Example
        ==================
        
        Here is an example of how to model with CyLP's modeling facility::
        
            import numpy as np
            from cylp.cy import CyClpSimplex
            from cylp.py.modeling.CyLPModel import CyLPArray
        
            s = CyClpSimplex()
        
            # Add variables
            x = s.addVariable('x', 3)
            y = s.addVariable('y', 2)
        
            # Create coefficients and bounds
            A = np.matrix([[1., 2., 0],[1., 0, 1.]])
            B = np.matrix([[1., 0, 0], [0, 0, 1.]])
            D = np.matrix([[1., 2.],[0, 1]])
            a = CyLPArray([5, 2.5])
            b = CyLPArray([4.2, 3])
            x_u= CyLPArray([2., 3.5])
        
            # Add constraints
            s += A * x <= a
            s += 2 <= B * x + D * y <= b
            s += y >= 0
            s += 1.1 <= x[1:3] <= x_u
        
            # Set the objective function
            c = CyLPArray([1., -2., 3.])
            s.objective = c * x + 2 * y.sum()
        
            # Solve using primal Simplex
            s.primal()
            print s.primalVariableSolution['x']
        
        
        
        Documentation
        ===============
        You may access CyLP's documentation:
        
        1. *Online* : Please visit http://mpy.github.io/cylpdoc/
